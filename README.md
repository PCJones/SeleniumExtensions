# SeleniumExtensions
This is a small library that grew over the years while I tried to automatize stuff with Selenium.

A lot of methods might be redundant by now as the Selenium.Support library has improved quite a bit, however for some this repository might still be helpful. 

Feature and pull requests are definitely welcome and appreciated!
