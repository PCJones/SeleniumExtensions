# SeleniumExtensions
This is a small library that has grown over the years as I have tried to automatize things with Selenium.

A lot of methods might be redundant by now, as the Selenium.Support library has improved quite a bit, but for some this repository might still be useful. 

Feature and pull requests are definitely welcome and appreciated!

95% of the Methods have documentation, if you find an error please report it.
Examples and more documentation will follow soon.
